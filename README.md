# Bohemian Rhapsody
## Queen

*1*<br>
Is this the real life?<br>
Is this just fantasy?<br>
Caught in a landslide<br>
No escape from reality<br>
Open your eyes<br>
Look up to the skies and see<br>
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br>
Because I'm easy come, easy go<br>
A little high, little low<br>
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me.<br>





























                                           ## ----------------4-------------
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, Scaramouch will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, figaro, magnifico
