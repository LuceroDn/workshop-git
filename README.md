# Bohemian Rhapsody
## Queen


*1*<br>
Is this the real life?<br>
Is this just fantasy?<br>
Caught in a landslide<br>
No escape from reality<br>
Open your eyes<br>
Look up to the skies and see<br>
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br>
Because I'm easy come, easy go<br>
A little high, little low<br>
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me.<br>

## ----------------4-------------
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, Scaramouch will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, figaro, magnifico

### 7
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye   
So you think you can love me and leave me to die  
Oh baby can't do this to me baby  
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here
